# NOTICE
My team and Org has decided to integrate Munki ([official munki repo](https://github.com/munki/munki)) since the code in this repo was slowly moving toward similar design and features of Munki. This repo is officialy retired, there are some forks out there and I suggest one use those if this is still to be used. JSS Importer has also been sunset for Jamf Uploader ([found here](https://github.com/grahampugh/jamf-upload/wiki)) so this repo is considere legacy at this point. I will leave the code up as there are still many valid code samples in here that one could find useful. Otherwise this is retired, and it has served my Org and team well for 3+ years automating app updates.

# Auto-Update
Automatically update apps with jamf policy driven workflows


Documentation will be in this repo's [Wiki page](https://github.com/t-lark/Auto-Update/wiki), please click on the wiki link above

Thanks
